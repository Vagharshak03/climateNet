                <h5 class="text-success font-weight-bold mb-3"><strong>PROFESSIONALIZATION</strong></h5>
                One of the differentiating elements of UFAR is professionalization. A factual proof lies in the fact
                that more than 92% of the alumni of the 15 UFAR promotions are working. To achieve a very high
                employability of its students, the university constantly studies the needs of the market. A vector of
                professionalization is therefore the design of courses and programs in relation to the expectations of
                companies. Similarly, teaching alternates theory and practice, with many case studies and industrial
                projects, led by a multitude of professional teachers in the field. To strengthen this axis of
                professionalization, Accelerator 28 (hyperlink to the accelerator) was created at the end of 2020, a
                support structure promoting entrepreneurship in Armenia.
                Professionalization internships in Armenia and abroad allow students to be best prepared for integration
                into the world of work. It should also be considered that many students work while pursuing their
                studies, which considerably strengthens the study/profession link.
                Finally, dedicated teams are in charge of supporting students in the emergence of their professional
                projects, while helping them acquire the necessary job search techniques.
                Specific support on the subject of integration is provided in the form of compulsory courses and
                personalized advice.

                <h5 class="text-warning font-weight-bold mb-3"><strong>INTEGRITY</strong></h5>
                The value of integrity was at the very foundation of the creation of UFAR. The university considers it
                necessary to develop and ensure a culture of integrity. As soon as they enter the University, students
                know that impartial evaluation, examination monitoring and disciplinary committees make UFAR an
                institution of integrity. This integrity is all the more important as students appropriate it and become
                its bearers in their daily actions and in their professional lives. Indeed, integrity is implemented in
                UFAR procedures but also in concrete projects with a strong ethical connotation. The university's desire
                is indeed to embody this value of integrity through concrete actions.
                This is how UFAR has set up a Plan for the Reintegration of Student Soldiers (PRES) and a program to
                help students with academic difficulties upon returning from military service, the PREMâ€™S (Plan for the
                Reintegration of Ex-Military Students towards Success). This makes it possible to show examples of
                integrity to students to encourage them to continue to embody this value as ambassadors of UFAR.

                <h5 class="text-info font-weight-bold mb-3"><strong>GATEWAY TO THE WORLD</strong></h5>
                A differentiating element of UFAR compared to its competitors is the link that UFAR creates for its
                students with Europe and the world. By obtaining a double degree (European/French and Armenian), by
                deepening foreign language (particularly French), by being in frequent contact with foreign teachers,
                UFAR students benefit from particularly strong international links. The solidity of the relations
                between UFAR and its associated universities reinforces UFAR as a true gateway to Europe. Finally, UFAR
                takes particular care to develop the French language among its students and in the country.
                The differentiating element of UFAR "Gateway to the World" has different components, the main one being
                the development of language learning. An investment in language learning will continue to be made not
                only for students but also for staff.
                Connecting students with many teachers (80 per year) strengthens access to international realities.
                International enrichment also comes from UFAR's links with different structures in French-speaking
                countries (OIF, AUF, local authorities, French-speaking agencies, etc.).
